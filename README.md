# LeetCode Challenges Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my LeetCode Challenges Repository! This repository is my personal collection of coding challenges from LeetCode, showcasing my problem-solving process, coding abilities, and documentation skills. Each challenge is accompanied by a detailed breakdown of my approach, including clarifying questions, pseudocode, my attempts, and alternative solutions.

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate my technical skills and thought process, and to serve as a resource for others preparing for technical interviews or seeking to improve their coding skills.

## Repository Structure
Each file in the repository corresponds to a specific challenge on LeetCode and includes the following sections:
- **Instructions**: The original problem statement from LeetCode.
- **Clarification Questions**: Questions I would ask to better understand the problem or constraints.
- **Pseudocode**: My initial approach to solving the challenge, expressed in pseudocode.
- **My Attempts**: Detailed code for each of my attempts, including explanations of my thought process and any issues I encountered.  If my first attempt is not successful, I will come back to the challenge in a month to hopefully solidify the concepts.
- **Alternative Solutions**: Exploration of different approaches to solve the problem, including more efficient or elegant solutions found within the LeetCode community or developed through further research.

## Contributing
While this repository is primarily a showcase of my own journey through LeetCode challenges, I welcome discussions and insights from others. If you have suggestions or want to discuss any of the challenges, please open an issue in the repository.
